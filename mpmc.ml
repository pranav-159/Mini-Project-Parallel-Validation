  # General idea
  
  It is the easiest to explain the general idea on an array of infinite size. 
  Let's start with that. Each element in such an array constitutes a single-use 
  exchange slot. Enqueuer increments [tail] and treats prior value as index of 
  its slot. Same for dequeuer and [head]. This effectively creates pairs 
  (enqueuer, dequeuer) assigned to the same slot. Enqueuer leaves the value in 
  the slot, dequer copies it out. 
   
  Enqueuer never fails. It always gets a brand-new slot and places item in it. 
  Dequeuer, on the other hand, may witness an empty slot. That's because [head] 
  may jump behind [tail]. Remember, indices are implemented blindy. For now, 
  assume dequeuer simply spins on the empty slot until an item appears. 

  That's it. There's a few things flowing from this construction: 
  * Slots are atomic. This is where paired enqueuer and dequeuer communicate. 
  * [head] overshooting [tail] is a normal condition and that's good - we want 
  to keep operations on [head] and [tail] independent.

  # Finite array

  Now, to make it work in real-world, simply treat finite array as circular, 
  i.e. wrap around when reached the end. Slots are now re-used, so we need to be 
  more careful. 
  
  Firstly, if there's too many items, enqueuer may witness a full slot. Let's assume 
  enqueuer simply spins on full slot until some dequeuer appears and takes the old
  value.
  
  Secondly, in the case of overlap, there can be more than 2 threads (1x enqueuer, 
  1x dequeuer) assigned to a single slot (imagine 10 enqueuers spinning on an 8-slot 
  array). In fact, it could be any number. Thus, all operations on slot have to use 
  CAS to ensure that no item is overwrriten on store and no item is dequeued by two 
  threads at once. 

  Above works okay in practise, and there is some relevant literature, e.g.  
  (DOI: 10.1145/3437801.3441583) analyzed this particular design. There's also 
  plenty older papers looking at similar approaches 
  (e.g. DOI: 10.1145/2851141.2851168). 

  Note, this design may violate FIFO (on overlap). The risk can be minimized by 
  ensuring size of array >> number of threads but it's never zero.
  (github.com/rigtorp/MPMCQueue has a nice way of fixing this, we could add it).

  # Blocking (non-lockfree paths on full, empty)

  Up until now [push] and [pop] were allowed to block indefinitely on empty and full 
  queue. Overall, what can be done in those states?

  1. Busy wait until able to finish.
  2. Rollback own index with CAS (unassign itself from slot).
  3. Move forward other index with CAS (assign itself to the same slot as opposite 
  action).
  4. Mark slot as burned - dequeue only.

  Which one then?

  Let's optimize for stability, i.e. some reasonable latency that won't get much worse
  under heavy load. Busy wait is great because it does not cause any contention in the
  hotspots ([head], [tail]). Thus, start with busy wait (1). If queue is busy and 
  moving fast, there is a fair chance that within, say, 30 spins, we'll manage to 
  complete action without having to add contention elsewhere. 
  
  Once N busy-loops happen and nothing changes, we probably want to return even if its 
  costs. (2), (3) both allow that. (2) doesn't add contention to the other index like 
  (3) does. Say, there's a lot more dequeuers than enqueuers, if all dequeurs did (3), 
  they would add a fair amount of contention to the [tail] index and slow the 
  already-outnumbered enqueuers further. So, (2) > (3) for that reason.

  However, with just (2), some dequeuers will struggle to return. If many dequeuers 
  constatly try to pop an element and fail, they will form a chain.

   tl                 hd
   |                  |
  [.]-[A]-[B]-[C]-..-[X]

  For A to rollback, B has to rollback first. For B to rollback C has to rollback first.

  [A] is likely to experience a large latency spike. In such a case, it is easier for [A]
  to do (3) rather than hope all other active dequeuers will unblock it at some point. 
  Thus, it's worthwile also trying to do (3) periodically.

  Thus, the current policy does (1) for a bit, then (1), (2) with periodic (3). 

  What about burned slots (4)?

  It's present in the literature. Weakly I'm not a fan. If dequeuers are faster to remove 
  items than enqueuers supply them, slots burned by dequeuers are going to make enqueuers 
  do even more work.

  # Resizing 

  The queue does not support resizing, but it can be simulated by wrapping it in a 
  lockfree list.

          Given that code above checks for overlap, is this CAS needed?

          Yes. Even though a thread cannot explicitely enter overlap,
          it can still occur just because enqueuer may theoretically be
          unscheduled for unbounded amount of time between incrementing
          index and filling the slot.

          I doubt we'd observe that case in real-life (outside some
          extreme circumstances), but this optimization has to be left
          for the user to decide. After all, algorithm would not pass
          model-checking without it.

          Incidentally, it also makes this method interoperable with
          standard interface.
